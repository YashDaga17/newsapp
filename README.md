## Features & Functionality

### 1. **Progress Bar**
   A **Progress Bar** is displayed when data is being fetched from an external source. It provides a visual representation of the loading process, assuring users that the content is on its way. The progress bar dynamically updates as the data loads, ensuring that users have feedback during the process.

### 2. **News Cards**
   The app uses **News Cards** to display news articles in an organized and visually appealing format. Each card includes the following information:
   - **Title**: The headline of the article.
   - **Description**: A brief summary of the article.
   - **Date**: The publication date of the article.
   - **Author**: The author or journalist who wrote the article.

   These cards allow users to easily browse through news articles and quickly find content that interests them.

### 3. **Sticky Navbar**
   The application includes a **Sticky Navbar**, which remains fixed at the top of the page as users scroll. This Navbar is designed for **category-based news selection**, allowing users to choose the category they are interested in, such as **Technology**, **Business**, **Sports**, and more. It enables easy navigation between different categories without losing track of the current section.

### 4. **Loading Spinner**
   A **Loading Spinner** (shown as a `loading.gif`) is used to indicate that news content is in the process of loading. The spinner appears when the page is fetching data and disappears once the data is ready to be displayed. This feature ensures that users know that the content is being loaded in the background, improving their overall experience.

### 5. **About Page**
   The **About Page** offers detailed information about the application. It explains the purpose of **NewsApp**, the features it includes, and how it works. This page serves as a guide for new users, helping them understand the app’s functionality and design.
